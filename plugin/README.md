# better-tg-cli

An unofficial, open-source Telegram client for your own account, packaged for Claude. The plugin
adds the `better-tg-cli` skill, which teaches Claude to use the `telegram` command-line tool, and a
local MCP server (`telegram mcp`, started with `npx better-tg-cli@<pinned version>`). With it Claude
can read and search your chats, open threads and forum topics, press bot buttons, and, only if you
allow it, send, edit, react and forward.

## Before you start

You need Node.js 20 or newer. Log in once, in your own terminal or through the guided page:

```bash
npm install -g better-tg-cli
telegram onboard      # opens a local page: get an invite or use your own API keys, scan a QR code
```

Claude never sees your login code, 2FA password, invite token or session. The session is stored in
the macOS Keychain, the Linux Secret Service, Windows DPAPI or 1Password.

## Safety

- Writing is off by default. `telegram write-access on` has to be confirmed by a person, in a
  terminal prompt or an OS dialog, and can expire (`--for 1h`). Every write is logged locally.
- The MCP server never exposes login, logout, account transfer or self-update.

## Where data goes

The plugin runs on your machine. It connects to:

- Telegram's own servers (MTProto), for everything a Telegram client does;
- the project's invite service (`tg-cli-broker.login-c2d.workers.dev`, also `better-tg-cli.com`),
  only when you log in with an invite, to exchange the invite for the app's API keys;
- `registry.npmjs.org`, once a day and only in an interactive terminal, to check for a newer version
  (turn off with `TG_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`).
